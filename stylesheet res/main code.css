/* I added borders on some images, so it would be easier to see their concrete position on the page. We can choose to remove
or to keep them, after every image is in the right place. But for now, let them stay where they are, because it's much easier
to tell where each image is.

/*
This is Sravith
I think we should have a border but lets not have it black, and lets keep it very very small. I think 1 pixel would be great.
And we should also have the color be more subtle, maybe light grey would be nice...
