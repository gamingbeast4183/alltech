<h1 class="Header" id="Title">Battle of the Styli: Apple Pencil, Surface Pen, or Pixelbook Pen?</h1>

<p class="Text">Both the Surface Pen and the Apple Pencil have been around for a long time. The first Surface Pen came out to the public in 2012 with the Surface Pro, and the Apple Pencil released in 2015 alongside the iPad Pro. However, now Google has thrown their own device into the mix, with the Google Pixelbook Pen (accompaniment to the Google Pixelbook). All three of these writing utensils are without doubt excellent devices, but you may want to know which one is the best of them all. Here, we will discover the answer to this question: Apple Pencil, Surface Pen, or Pixelbook Pen?</p>
<p class="Text">The main categories we will use to compare the pens are design, execution, and features, mainly because these are the most important. However, that is not to say that there aren’t other important aspects of each stylus, and we will cover those in passing during the article.</p>
<p class="Text Note">Note: The Surface Pen has gone through major changes between the latest model and the previous version. Therefore, we will refer to the latest version as 4th generation, and the pen that shipped with the Surface Pro 4 will be called 3rd generation, for the sake of comparison.</p>

<h1 class="Header">Design</h1>

<p class="Text">Only a small portion of what you may think is design is the pure aesthetic look of the pen. Although it is undeniable that the three pens look terrific, that is only part of the picture. Design is in part looks, but also includes the comfort of using the pen. Each of these three pens have their strengths and weaknesses in these two aspects. </p>
<p class="Text">The Surface Pen, in our opinion, looks the most like a normal pen. The top button slightly resembles the button of an actual pen, and similar to how there are clips on the side of every pen, there was a clip on the side of the Surface Pen (which unfortunately got removed when SP2017 released) too. To this effect, I liked the looks of the Surface Pen mainly because of the degree of realism. We do mourn the loss of a pen clip greatly, but the rest of the pen still looks fabulous and the new features definitely make up for this. Holding the Surface Pen when writing is almost identical to holding a real pen. The only difference is, obviously, that a side of the Surface Pen is flat. Therefore, when holding the pen, I put my thumb on the flat side with my index and middle finger resting on the opposite side. It worked very well. The pen didn’t slip out of my hand, and I could write with the pen well even while gripping it very lightly. For such a smooth pen, I was surprised that it didn’t fall out of my hands, but it stayed there.</p>
<p class="Text">On the other hand, the Apple Pencil looks similar to a real pencil. The streamlined shape and point of the Pencil bear closely resemble the No. 2 pencil, with the top part being the only major difference; the top of the Apple Pencil is rounded, unlike the flatter look of a pencil eraser. Unlike the Surface Pen, there are no protrusions or any add-ons to the chassis of the pen, save for a Lightning connector which is used to charge the Pencil (more on this soon). In terms of comfort, the Apple Pencil was essentially the same as the Surface Pen. Although completely round, one could hold the pen in such a way that it didn’t fall out of your hand, regardless of how smooth it was to the touch. Since the Pencil has such an amazing tilt feature, the lack of a flat side to grip could prove a blessing in disguise. You can easily loosen your hold just enough to slide the stylus a little bit farther out of your hand, and use the side of the tip to shade lightly in an area. I have to admit, this was a very well thought out part of the device. </p>
<p class="Text">When I first saw pictures of the Pixelbook Pen, I hated it. I detested the flat top, the size, and the general shape of the stylus. Then, I looked at it in person, and it was shockingly better than I expected. First, it is not as short as pictures make it out to be. It is actually longer than the Surface Pen, with a length of 147mm over Surface Pen’s 145. Second, the pen is definitely thicker than the other two, but is still thin enough so the flat top does not prove to be extremely detractive. Finally, the rounded portion leading up to the tip of the pen looks, in my opinion, beautiful. The Pixelbook Pen feels great to hold, too, although holding it is a different experience than holding the other styli. Since the end of the pen is bell-shaped rather than pointy, you can choke farther up on your pen grip. However, one thing I don’t like is that the button aligns with your top fingers rather than the thumb. That is merely a matter of preference, however, and you may like having a button under your index finger. And it is good that the button is aligned perfectly with the finger, because you can use that button for a whole host of other features that come with the Google Pixelbook.</p>

<h1 class="Header">Execution</h1>

<p class="Text">When researching any device, the most important factor is obviously how well it does the job. Stylus pens are no exception, because they have a lot to do and must do it properly. Stylus pens face the challenge of just how smoothly they write, and each of the three pens stack up pretty well in this area.</p>
<p class="Text">The Surface Pen is a terrific inker. The pens feel extremely smooth to write with, and the latest pen is almost entirely lag-free with a 21-millisecond latency. A mediocre-level tilt-sensitivity feature is added with the 4th generation pen for shading easily, and it can detect up to 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity when writing, which makes for an incredibly smooth transition between stroke thicknesses. One can also (hi prem, respond if u see this) buy four additional pen tips that vary in hardness. The measurement of hardness used is representative of traditional pencils, with a tip each for 2H (hardest), H, HB, and B (softest). These differences are, although clearly labeled as different, incredibly subtle when writing in an app such as OneNote. However, when using apps like this, I noticed that the latest update brought a whole host of annoying glitches to the pen, which all require either a reboot of the computer or a restart of the driver to fix. They aren’t incredibly horrible, but they are an inconvenience th As for charging, the AAAA battery that powers it does a spectacular job. I used the pen moderately for a little over a year, and only half of the percentage has depleted so far. However, customers who have very frequently used the pen (as in, every day for 45 minutes or so) have reported it to run out of charge after 6-8 months. Nevertheless, if your pen does die, simply twist the top of the pen right off and replace the battery, which you can buy in a 6-pack for $4.94 on Amazon. With all of these customization options and the incredible hardware leads to one of the best pen experiences in the market today.</p>
<p class="Text">The Apple Pencil, on the other hand, takes a different approach to the whole concept of inking. The pens feel extremely smooth to write with, but the tips are made of plastic rather than the soft, rubber-like material of the Surface Pen. While it would have been nice to see the soft rubber tips on the Apple Pencil, Apple has decided to use plastic. However, it works even better than the Surface Pen. The pen has the lowest lag of any pen yet, with 20 milliseconds of delay in writing. However, this benefit only comes with the 2017 iPad Pro, as Apple has chosen to make their iPad Pro panels have 120Hz, brought the lag from 40 milliseconds to 20 milliseconds, With the pencil, Apple added an excellent tilt-sensitivity, and pressure sensitivity details remain unspecified. Unfortunately, however, Apple never released different types of pen tips to enhance the user’s experience, instead selling replacements of the current tip. We hope to see this in the next gen Apple Pencil Apple pulls this move. The charging of the pen is incredibly annoying, because you have to plug the phone into the iPad for 30 minutes to charge it fully. It is not a long time, and it certainly isn’t a big deal. This is where the other two styli overcome this same inconvenience quite easily by using batteries. Even then, 15 seconds of charging will provide for an extra 20-30 minutes of battery life, so obviously you do not have to charge it fully to continue your work. You can also charge the Apple Pencil by plugging it into the provided Lightning adapter, and plugging a Lightning cable into the other end.  Just note, however, that this takes longer to charge (70-75 minutes) and you still cannot use the Pencil while it is charging. I did notice that compared to the amazing battery lives of the Surface Pen and Pixelbook Pen, the Apple Pencil’s battery life is very annoyingly short. Apple may want to work on that. However, the Apple Pencil altogether gives a pleasant experience for any iPad user. </p>
<p class="Text">Writing with the Pixelbook Pen, just like the other two, feels very smooth; for Google’s debut into the pen world, I think they have done a terrific job. Google advertises many features, such as 2000 levels of pressure sensitivity and 10 milliseconds of lag. Although saying 2000 levels of pressure makes sense, the lag definitely is not 10 milliseconds. The only app I could find where the lag was that low was in Google Keep, and in that app, it felt like writing on paper. In apps like OneNote, however, the lag was significantly higher, noticeably higher than the Surface Pen and Apple Pencil. The tilt sensitivity is average, similar to on the Surface Pen, and nowhere near the level of Apple Pencil. However, Google’s Pixelbook ot exist on Windows and iOS, such as using your pen as a laser pointer (for presentations), circling text to search it with Google Assistant, and more. The pen charges with one AAAA battery, just like the Surface Pen, and it is definitely in my opinion easier to take apart than the Surface Pen. This being a relatively new device, we have not tested the full battery life, but theoretically, it should last for a full year before battery replacement is required. When it does die, you can pick up a 6-pack of batteries for south of five dollars on Amazon, as stated above. </p>

</ul>

<p class="Text">Overall, all three of these pens are solid devices with their own strengths and weaknesses. If you plan to do mostly art-related things, I would suggest going for the iPad Pro and Apple Pencil, because the low lag and enhanced tilt sensitivity are useful for painting or sketches. If you want a device for school, but with the added functionality of having a stylus, get the Pixelbook and get the Pen, because the Google Assistant is helpful for whatever you may throw its way and the device as a whole is terrific for students. However, if you want a device with full laptop functionality that can also double as a tablet, and you want to draw as well as take notes, go for the Surface and Surface Pen. All 3 give incredible experiences with the stylus. Whichever of these three you decide to buy, you will not regret it. </p>
