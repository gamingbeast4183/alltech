<h3>Why you might want to use a Chromebook instead of a PC or Mac</h3> 
 
<p>The Windows OS has been out for a long time, since the days of IBM. They have a ton of installable apps, have varying features that come at the manufacturer’s discretion, and they are incredibly useful for a substantial amount of different needs, provided you pick the computer that is best for you. But macOS also brings a lot of great features to the table, with the quick-and-easy synchronization with other Apple devices, as well as the suite of pre-installed apps that come with a macOS device right out of the box. But between the two, Google came out with their own operating system much later on: Chrome OS. Chrome OS is a specialized operating system that runs specifically on Chromebooks, with a variety of advantages and disadvantages. Read on to find out if a Chromebook would be right for you! </p>
<p>Note: Most of the information provided has been determined with a more averagely-priced and averagely-powerful Chromebook. Of course, you could pay a couple hundred dollars more and go for a more expensive Chromebook, but that really defeats the purpose.</p>  
 
<h3>Use Intensity</h3> 
<p>What do you plan on doing with your Chromebook? If you want to do some simple browsing, maybe look at your Facebook or quickly crop a photo, a Chromebook is probably really a good option for you. The quick boot time and the extensive battery life guarantees a long-lasting experience suitable for milder usage. But if you want to, for example, play video games on your Chromebook, I highly doubt the Chromebook’s 2-4GB memory and lack of a separate graphics card will be enough for even a mediocre gaming experience. Similarly, video editing or raw photo editing just will not work, unless you spring for a more expensive Chromebook (in which case, just go get a Windows computer and save yourself the trouble). </p>
 
<h3>Ease of Use</h3> 
 
<p>There is only a limited amount of apps in the Chrome Web Store. You can’t really sideload apps, or install .exe or .app files the way you can on PCs and Macs. But this is actually a blessing in disguise! Because of this, Chromebooks are extremely easy to use. They boot very quickly, they load browser pages in the blink of an eye, and are generally a great experience because you don’t need to concern yourself with the bloatware and extras that come with Windows or macOS. Plus, they are super light and thin and make for a great on-the-go device. So if you don’t need all those new-fangled features and fancy stuff, and just want something sleek and fast for the uses mentioned above, get a Chromebook and save yourself the hassle.</p>  
 
<h3>Development</h3> 
 
<p>Chrome OS is a limited OS, with heavy reliance on the browser. So you may be wondering, “How would it even be possible to do any programming or web development or anything like that on a Chromebook?” And we wouldn’t blame you for wondering that, because it doesn’t seem obvious at first. You can’t just install Python or some sort of C++ IDE or anything like that. But in all Chromebooks, there is an option to set your device in Developer Mode, granting you access to the computer’s Crosh shell and more developer features. Even with Developer Mode turned on, though, you still can’t install text editors and other apps that aren’t available on the Web Store. Which is why one can use the Crouton tool to dual-boot Ubuntu alongside Chrome OS. In Ubuntu, you are freed from the shackles of Chrome OS, and can install your text editors and fancy browsers and other apps to your heart’s content. And unless you want to do some heavy system-modding or production testing for your company or something like that, the 2-4GB of RAM should suffice for any development needs. </p>
 
<h3>Android App Testing</h3> 
 
<p>If you’re an aspiring developer who creates apps for the Google Play Store, you probably have some sort of at least somewhat powerful device to run Android Studio, Google’s Java IDE for Android app development. Now, I’m not saying that a Chromebook could possibly replace the need for Android Studio, because it most likely can’t unless you buy a more expensive device due to Android Studio being very resource-heavy. But Chromebooks are perfect for testing the apps, as now a majority of Chromebooks can install and run apps from the Play Store, and can natively test any Android apps. So with a Chromebook, you will no longer need an emulator to test apps on Chrome OS, and your apps can be supported on big and small screens alike.  </p>
 
<h3>Budget</h3> 
 
<p>At this point, you’ve probably assessed your needs in a laptop, and if you were so inclined, have taken a good, long look at some of the Chromebooks out there. Now the only concern you still have is budget. A lot of Chromebooks are significantly cheaper than similar Windows laptops, and way, way cheaper than a standard MacBook. You can always find a $500 Chromebook that you like, but at that point you might as well go for a Windows computer of the same price. If you’ve read the sections above and have decided that a Chromebook is right for you, we suggest you consider a Chromebook that amounts to $200-300 max., because they are significantly cheaper than other computers and are still the same thing as more expensive, fancier Chromebooks. Myself, I have an Acer Chromebook 11, and after three years of use and a couple months of leaving it dormant, it still works just as nicely as I want it to. </p>
  
 
<h3>Conclusion</h3> 
 
<p>Overall, Chromebooks appeal to a very specific percentage of all computer users. Not everyone spends their full computer time browsing the web or drawing in some drawing app they found. But if you find that these reasons above fit your daily habits, I would seriously consider getting a Chromebook, and saving the money you might spend on a PC or MacBook.</p>
