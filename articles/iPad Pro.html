    The iPad Pro
   </h1>
   <p class="Text">
  The iPad Pro. Stunning, isn't it? It is my favorite out of all the tablet-laptop hybrids. It is even advertised as a laptop. Apple released an iPad commercial called "What's a Computer?" It was pretty cheesy for the most part, but I think it got the point across. It showed how versatile the device was, and how it could be used as a replacement for your laptop. I thought it was pretty nice. But I'm not here to compliment the ad, I'm here to answer the question: can an iPad Pro really replace your regular computing device

    What is it
   </h1>
   <p class="Text">
  It's an iPad. I know, shocker. But it is remarkably powerful. There are two sizes that the iPad Pro ships in: a 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch. The 10.5 is a nice sweet spot between the larger and smaller tablets, by letting you compute a bit and also doubling as a great tablet. It's a great device. But the larger, 12.9-inch device is overkill. 13 inches is huge for a tablet, but since we want to use it as a laptop, I can let this slide. Other than size, everything is exactly the same between the two. And that is it, a supercharged tablet that Apple wants you to use instead of a regular computer.

    How it Compares
   </h1>
   <p class="Text">
    A MacBook Pro 2017 and the iPad Pro 2017 aren't that far apart. They are actually, very close. In benchmarks, single-core scores are around 200 points away, with the MacBook Pro leading, and multi-core scores around 300 points away, with the MacBook Pro leading once again. But if you really see these scores, there isn't much difference. While using it, a regular user probably won't be able to tell the difference. In fact, most users won't be able to. Metal GPU scores, however, are a different story. The iPad leads by as much as around 600 points in a fair comparison. While you have to give the ARM chipset for outperforming Intel HD (that actually isn't much of a feat anyway), it isn't too far apart. The point is, whatever "computer" you use, you will be getting a ton of performance from each of these devices

    My Experience
   </h1>
   <p class="Text">
   The iPad Pro is definitely no PC. It's just a tablet with extreme power. And that is what my experience was. Just a really fast tablet. Before iOS 11, you couldn't get apps that weren't in the App Store. The fact that now there is a files app changes a lot. But it doesn't mean these apps are good. Unless you get work apps directly from the App Store, there is no guarantee these "other" apps will work. If all you need is Google Docs, Hangouts, and a web browser, the iPad Pro is enough. All of these apps are available in the App Store, so they are optimized. But there is another side to this story. Maybe you code, that is your job. Well that is the reason iPad won't work for you. There is no easy or professional way to do this. I do a lot of digital artwork, which means the iPad Pro with the Apple Pencil is great for me. I type up many articles, and the support for a keyboard is really nice. And I also like to do some light gaming, and the iPad can handle that just fine. But I also code, and I can't let that slip. Yes, I have a different computer that is more powerful than this iPad in every different way, but I want a tablet replacement. I can do most things on this iPad, which is nice, but as soon as I can code on this, I know that the iPad Pro is complete for me. All in all, it really depends on what you do. If you are a student that needs to type of some stuff for school and browse the web, then yea! It is probably the right product for you. If you are a content creator this is definitely not enough (unless you want to use iMovie). Many people that answer this question are usually content creators, so of course it won't be enough. Here at AllTech, we write for everyone. So, I would say, find out what your needs are and then take the step.

    What About the Future
   </h1>
   <p class="Text">
We are going in the direction of replacing laptops with tablets. Microsoft, for example, makes extremely powerful tablets that run full Windows. That gives them flexibility. Apple, makes extremely powerful tablets, but it doesn't run the most favorable OS. All I can say is, the chips Apple uses for iPad Pros are very powerful. The OS... not so much. As soon as Apple makes a nicer OS for this iPad, tablets will receive the hype they had in 2012. All I can say is, we are headed in the right direction, and a world where everyone is using iPads and tablets as computers is very close by, and we will definitely like it.
