  <h1 class="Header" id="Title">Ubuntu vs. Windows 10 (and how to make the switch)</h1>
  <h2 class="Header">What is Ubuntu?</h2>

  <p class="Text">Ubuntu is a distribution of the Linux operating system. It shares many features with Windows and macOS, but is also extremely different. Ubuntu can be a terrific new experience for anyone who uses his or her computer frequently. Moreover, if used correctly, it can be a powerhouse of an OS. Some of the cool things about Ubuntu are: </p>

  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li class="Text">Ubuntu comes with a plethora of apps and packages that you would have to install externally on Windows, like a word processor (LibreOffice) and an archive manager, among other things.</li>
    <li class="Text">You can do anything in the system, if you both learn how to use the Bash terminal and have admin privileges. While Windows usually complains about "not having admin privileges" and doesn’t let you do things like delete useless files or move folders to the right place, Ubuntu will let you do whatever you want as long as you type in the command correctly.  </li>
    <li class="Text">If you know what you are doing, you can directly edit the code in the OS. Ubuntu is written in C, and any bugs or general things you want to change can be patched if you know how. For example, if the touch screen does not work in your computer, you can patch the source code manually instead of having to buy another computer.*
      <br />
      <p id="Warning"><i><b>WARNING: With great power comes great responsibility. Ubuntu won’t stop you from deleting every file on your hard drive, from editing crucial binaries, or anything else like that. Therefore, be careful, do your research before typing anything in the terminal, and be very careful before modifying the system in any way.</b></i></p>
    </li>
    <li class="Text">Unlike a majority of other OSes, Ubuntu is completely free for download off their website. While one would have to do some very shady and mostly illegal things which we do not condone here at AllTech to get Windows 10 or macOS for free, Ubuntu can be downloaded right off the website and installed. </li>
    <li class="Text">Linux does not force updates on you the way Microsoft does. If you want an update, you can install it, but if you do not want the update, you can wait until you are ready to update. In addition, if you download an LTS version of Ubuntu (we recommend this!), you will continue to get support for your version of Ubuntu for the next 5 years without having to update. </li>
    <li class="Text">The shell also comes with many developer tools preinstalled, such as Git and a Python interpreter. However, these things will only matter to developers, and will not affect the average user. </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Text Note">*On the Surface Pro  let line of devices, the touch screen and pen, as well as the Type Cover, will not work right off the bat. You will need some extra supplies if you use a Surface, and they will be mentioned in the list. Links will also be provided with instructions to fix this, because some very smart people have fixed the issues themselves and released their code to the public for the benefit of other Surface users.</p>
  <p class="Text">There are indeed many other cool things about Ubuntu, but we cannot list them all here. However, Ubuntu is complicated to download and install on a non-Linux device if you do not know how to do it. So here, we are going to outline the steps on how to install Ubuntu on your Windows computer. </p>

  <h2 class="Header">Supplies Necessary:</h2>

  <ul class="List">
    <li class="Text">any computer running Windows (instructions are for Windows 10, but Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 should be more or less the same)</li>
    <li class="Text">a USB drive with at least 2GB of space (the drive will be formatted, so make sure you back up any files you have stored)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="Header">If you are using a Surface device:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li class="Text">a USB hub with at least three ports</li>
    <li class="Text">a separate keyboard and mouse to use, because the Type Cover and touch screen won’t work until you add the new kernel (which we’ll include instructions for) </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Text Note">Another note: I only tested the installation with a Surface device and a normal laptop. In theory, other computers with detachable keyboards would have this problem as well, but Surfaces require some extra drivers, so that could also be the issue. I'm not entirely sure here.</p>

  <h2 class="Header">Step 1: Prepping the USB Drive</h2>

  <p class="Text">Before you even install Ubuntu, you have to create your installation media. For that, you will need the 2GB or higher USB drive that you picked up earlier. If it is an older drive, you really should back up your files to your computer, because that drive will be erased completely.</p>
  <p class="Text">Now that you have your USB drive, go to the <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Ubuntu download website.</a></p>
  <p class="Text">Here, you can choose between Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.10. 16.04LTS is the latest Long-Term Support build, meaning that your device will receive security updates and other patches and things like that for 5 years, even if you choose not to upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu. However, 16.04 is an older build, which released August 3, 2017, and is more difficult to get working on a Surface. The latest build is 17.10, which released October 19 and works better on Surface devices. Unfortunately, however, the 17.10 build is not LTS, and it will only continue to be supported until July 2018, at which point you will need to upgrade. We will leave it up to you to choose a version, because both require the same instructions to install.</p>
  <p class="Text">Whichever version you chose, you need to click the big green button that says "Download" next to it. It will take you to a page where you can choose either to donate, or to continue to the download. After you leave that page, the download will start automatically. Right now, it does not matter where the file is saved. Wait for the download to finish.</p>
  <p class="Text">Then go ahead <a href="https://etcher.io">to the website</a> to download the software Etcher. Etcher is what we use to flash the Ubuntu disk image to our USB stick. Go to the link, then click on the blue "Download" button, and wait for the installer to download. Once complete, run the file and install it. I am not going to go into detail, because the installer is very straightforward.</p>
  <p class="Text">If you are on a Surface, plug in your USB hub and plug in your flash drive to that. Otherwise, plug in your flash drive to any of the ports on your computer.</p>
  <p class="Text">Now, before running Etcher, check to see if you have administrator permissions, or switch to an account that does (Etcher will not work without admin permissions). Then, run Etcher. You should see three images, two of which are faded out. Click on the box underneath the first image, and locate and select the Ubuntu download you did earlier. It should have a .iso file extension. Then, click on the word "Change" under the second image, and select the USB drive you have plugged in. It usually defaults to the flash drive, but it never hurts to make sure that is the one selected. Finally, click on the button labeled "Flash!" and wait for the process to finish. When complete, close out of Etcher and remove your USB drive.</p>

  <h2 class="Header">Step 2: Prepping the Computer</h2>

  <p class="Text">Now that you have a prepared Ubuntu USB drive, we have to prep the computer hard drive for the installation. We need to create a partition for Ubuntu, and boot the computer from your installation media. Starting from here, we strongly advise you pull this tutorial up on another device, and read it from there. Because this step will involve rebooting the computer, and thus losing all of your open webpages.</p>
  <p class="Text">Type in the keyboard shortcut Win+R to bring up Run. Then, type in "diskmgmt.msc" in the search bar (without quotes). It will bring up the Disk Management utility. Here, you will see a list of partitions at the top, and the partitions in box form at the bottom. Partitions are the different "sections" of the hard drive, and every OS usually has multiple partitions in use. For Ubuntu, we need to create a partition and Ubuntu will manage the partition itself. So, right-click the primary partition in your disk management tool. On my computer, it shows a "Recovery" partition and an "EFI system" partition, as well as a bigger "Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, Primary Partition". </p>
  <p class="Text">Right-click the latter partition and you should see a menu with options. One of these options should be "Shrink volume". Click on that. A pop-up will appear, saying, "Querying volume for available shrink space, please wait…" Then a pop-up will appear with some numbers. The first box states the total size of the disk before shrinking, and the next box will say the total amount of shrink space available. In the third box, where it reads "Enter the amount of shrink space", enter the amount of space you want the OS to have (in megabytes). I did 17000 because my computer only has a 128GB SSD, but we recommend doing between 20000 and 25000 megabytes. After that is done, you can click "Shrink". Once the shrinking finishes, it will show a block of "Unallocated" space. LEAVE IT ALONE.</p>
  <p class="Text">Booting from the installation media is easy enough. Open the Windows menu, and click the Power icon. Now, hold down Shift, click the button that says "Restart", and do not let go of Shift until you have a screen that looks like this:</p>
  <div class="Image-container"><img class="Image" src="../image res/Ubuntu Win10 images/Advanced startup menu.png"/></div>
  <p class="Text Note">This is the Advanced Startup menu.</p>
  <p class="Text">Then, click on the button that says, "Use a device". Once there, you can boot from a USB drive by clicking the button that says "USB storage" or something along those lines. For my device, it said "USB storage". For another device, it said "USB FDD". It may vary for you, but just try anything that says "USB" until you get to the GRUB menu. If anything shows up and you don’t know what it is, just hold down your power button for about 20-30 seconds to shut down the computer, then turn the computer on again and go back to the Advanced Startup menu (pictured).</p>

  <h2 class="Header">Step 3: Installing Ubuntu</h2>

  <p class="Text">GRUB is the bootloader that Ubuntu and other Linux distros use. When you boot from your USB device, assuming it worked, you will see a screen with small text on it. At the top, it should say "GNU GRUB" followed by a version number. You will see a number of options below that. Among those options should be "Install Ubuntu" and "Try Ubuntu without installing". Before installing Ubuntu, it is always a good idea to try it without installing, so that you can get a feel for the OS and decide if you like it. If you install it and end up not liking it, it is a pain to uninstall.</p>
  <p class="Text"><i>Surface Users: Get your external keyboard and mouse, and plug them into the USB hub. In my experience, when installing Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, the Type Cover and touchpad did not work right away, and I needed the keyboard and mouse to navigate the installation wizard. After installing, I still needed it so I could go to the links at the bottom of this page and install a patched kernel.</i></p>
  <p class="Text">Click "Try Ubuntu without installing". It will take you into the Ubuntu operating system. Here, you can play around with it for a bit. If you decide you do not like it, simply restart your computer, either by holding down the Power button for 7-10 seconds or by finding the restart button in the top-right corner of the screen. If you do like it, though, click on the icon on the desktop that says "Install Ubuntu" and the version. </p>
  <p class="Text">It will bring up the installation wizard, which is mostly straightforward except for one step. In the installation wizard, you will first have to choose a language. Choose your language, and move on to the next step. Here, you can choose a Wi-Fi network to connect to. I connected to my home Wi-Fi, and continued. Next, it will ask you if you want to install external drivers. Choose the option "Install third party software for graphics and Wi-Fi hardware, MP3, and other media". Then, click Next. When it asks you how you want to install Ubuntu, select the "Something Else" option at the very bottom of the window. </p>
  <p class="Text"><i>This is the hardest step in the entire installation, so follow the instructions carefully. If you do not follow the instructions correctly, you might break your computer and will have to reinstall Windows. So, please pay close attention.</i></p>
  <p class="Text">In the top section of the window, there will be a list of partitions. They will be labeled “dev/sda” followed by a number. Do not select any of these. Instead, scroll down to where it says “free space” and the number of megabytes you selected for your Ubuntu partition.</p>
  <div class="Image-container"><img class="Image" src="../image res/Ubuntu Win10 images/partition selection menu.png"/></div>
  <p class="Text">	Once the free space has been selected, click the + button (circled in red in the picture above). You will see a pop-up. Here, you need to set the Size to 3000 MB and the Mount Point to “/home” (without quotes). Then, you will see the new partition pop-up. Click the free space again and this time, set the size to the highest number it can reach. The Mount Point for this partition should be “/” (again, without quotes). It is literally just a forward slash, but it is important. Make sure it is a forward slash and not a backslash. Finally, you can go ahead and click “Install Now” to start the installation. Just wait until it finishes, and then, you can go ahead and use Ubuntu!</p>

  <h2 class="Header">Step 4: For Surfaces</h2>

  <p class="Text">After you installed Ubuntu, you may notice that either your Type Cover does not work, your touchpad does not work, your Surface Pen does not work, your touch screen does not work, or any combination of these. Unfortunately, Windows comes with preinstalled Surface drivers and other things that make it work, and Ubuntu does not have these. Therefore, after installing your version of Ubuntu, you need to install a separate kernel that has been patched. On 16.04 LTS, there are three kernels to choose from, but I recommend fridgecow's kernel because it worked best for me. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SurfaceLinux/comments/4t64zt/getting_the_sp4_running_with_ubuntu_1604/">this link</a> for instructions on how to install a patched kernel for this version of Ubuntu. You can choose between three kernels, or compile your own, but I strongly recommend fridgecow's kernel. The instructions are fairly clear there, so I'll leave you at that.</p>
  <p class="Text">On Ubuntu 17.10, on the other hand, I used jakeday's kernel. His Github repository with the kernel, as well as installation instructions, can be found <a href="">here.</a> It does not make it clear at the start, but you need to download the repository by clicking on the green button that says "Clone or Download", then "Download ZIP". Then, you need to extract the contents of the ZIP archive to your Downloads folder.</p>
