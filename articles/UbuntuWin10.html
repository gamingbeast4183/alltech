  <h1 class="Header" id="Title">Ubuntu vs. Windows 10 (and how to make the switch)</h1>
  <h2 class="Header">What is Ubuntu?</h2>

  <p class="Text Indent ">Ubuntu is a distribution of the Linux operating system. It shares many features with Windows and macOS, but is also extremely different. Ubuntu can be a terrific new experience for anyone who uses his or her computer frequently. Moreover, if used correctly, it can be a powerhouse of an OS. Some of the cool things about Ubuntu are: </p>

  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
    <li class="Text">Ubuntu comes with a plethora of apps and packages that you would have to install externally on Windows, like a word processor (LibreOffice) and an archive manager, among other things.</li>
    <li class="Text">You can do anything in the system, if you both learn how to use the Bash terminal and have admin privileges. While Windows usually complains about "not having admin privileges" and doesn’t let you do things like delete useless files or move folders to the right place, Ubuntu will let you do whatever you want as long as you type in the command correctly.  </li>
    <li class="Text">If you know what you are doing, you can directly edit the code in the OS. Ubuntu is written in C, and any bugs or general things you want to change can be patched if you know how. For example, if the touch screen does not work in your computer, you can patch the source code manually instead of having to buy another computer.*
      <br />
      <p id="Warning"><i><b>WARNING: With great power comes great responsibility. Ubuntu won’t stop you from deleting every file on your hard drive, from editing crucial binaries, or anything else like that. Therefore, be careful, do your research before typing anything in the terminal, and be very careful before modifying the system in any way.</b></i></p>
    </li>
    <li class="Text">Unlike a majority of other OSes, Ubuntu is completely free for download off their website. While one would have to do some very shady and mostly illegal things which we do not condone here at AllTech to get Windows 10 or macOS for free, Ubuntu can be downloaded right off the website and installed. </li>
    <li class="Text">Linux does not force updates on you the way Microsoft does. If you want an update, you can install it, but if you do not want the update, you can wait until you are ready to update. In addition, if you download an LTS version of Ubuntu (we recommend this!), you will continue to get support for your version of Ubuntu for the next 5 years without having to update. </li>
    <li class="Text">The shell also comes with many developer tools preinstalled, such as Git and a Python interpreter. However, these things will only matter to developers, and will not affect the average user. </li>
  </ul>
  <p class="Text Note">*On the Surface Pro Indent let line of devices, the touch screen and pen, as well as the Type Cover, will not work right off the bat. You will need some extra supplies if you use a Surface, and they will be mentioned in the list. Links will also be provided with instructions to fix this, because some very smart people have fixed the issues themselves and released their code to the public for the benefit of other Surface users.</p>
  <p class="Text Indent ">There are indeed many other cool things about Ubuntu, but we cannot list them all here. However, Ubuntu is complicated to download and install on a non-Linux device if you do not know how to do it. So here, we are going to outline the steps on how to install Ubuntu on your Windows computer. </p>

  <h2 class="Header">Supplies Necessary:</h2>

  <ul class="List">
    <li class="Text">any computer running Windows (instructions are for Windows 10, but Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 should be more or less the same)</li>
    <li class="Text">a USB drive with at least 2GB of space (the drive will be formatted, so make sure you back up any files you have stored)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="Header">If you are using a Surface device:</h3>

  <ul>
    <li class="Text">a USB hub with at least three ports</li>
    <li class="Text">a separate keyboard and mouse to use, because the Type Cover and touch screen won’t work until you add the new kernel (which we’ll include instructions for) </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="Text Note">Another note: I only tested the installation with a Surface device and a normal laptop. In theory, other computers with detachable keyboards would have this problem as well, but Surfaces require some extra drivers, so that could also be the issue. I'm not entirely sure here.</p>

  <h2 class="Header">Step 1: Prepping the USB Drive</h2>

  <p class="Text Indent ">Before you even install Ubuntu, you have to create your installation media. For that, you will need the 2GB or higher USB drive that you picked up earlier. If it is an older drive, you really should back up your files to your computer, because that drive will be erased completely.</p>
  <p class="Text Indent ">Now that you have your USB drive, go to the <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">Ubuntu download website.</a></p>
  <p class="Text Indent ">Here, you can choose between Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 17.10. 16.04LTS is the latest Long-Term Support build, meaning that your device will receive security updates and other patches and things like that for 5 years, even if you choose not to upgrade to a new version of Ubuntu. However, 16.04 is an older build, which released August 3, 2017, and is also incredibly difficult to get working on a Surface. The latest build is 17.10, which released October 19 and works better on Surface devices. Unfortunately, however, the 17.10 build is not LTS, and it will only continue to be supported until July 2018, at which point you will need to upgrade. We will leave it up to you to choose a version, because both require the same instructions to install.</p>
  <p class="Text Indent ">Whichever version you chose, you need to click the big green button that says "Download" next to it. It will take you to a page where you can choose either to donate, or to continue to the download. After you leave that page, the download will start automatically. Right now, it does not matter where the file is saved. Wait for the download to finish.</p>
  <p class="Text Indent ">Then go ahead to the link https://etcher.io. Etcher is what we use to flash the Ubuntu disk image to our USB stick. Go to the link, then click on the blue "Download" button, and wait for the installer to download. Once complete, run the file and install it. I am not going to go into detail, because the installer is very straightforward.</p>
  <p class="Text Indent ">If you are on a Surface, plug in your USB hub and plug in your flash drive to that. Otherwise, plug in your flash drive to any of the ports on your computer.</p>
  <p class="Text Indent ">Now, before running Etcher, check to see if you have administrator permissions, or switch to an account that does (Etcher will not work without admin permissions). Then, run Etcher. You should see three images, two of which are faded out. Click on the box underneath the first image, and locate and select the Ubuntu download you did earlier. It should have a .iso file extension. Then, click on the word "Change" under the second image, and select the USB drive you have plugged in. It usually defaults to the flash drive, but it never hurts to make sure that is the one selected. Finally, click on the button labeled "Flash!" and wait for the process to finish. When complete, close out of Etcher and remove your USB drive.</p>

  <h2 class="Header">Step 2: Prepping the Computer</h2>

  <p class="Text Indent ">Now that you have a prepared Ubuntu USB drive, we have to prep the computer hard drive for the installation. We need to create a partition for Ubuntu, and boot the computer from your installation media. Starting from here, we strongly advise you pull this tutorial up on another device, and read it from there. Because this step will involve rebooting the computer, and thus losing all of your open webpages.</p>
  <p class="Text Indent ">Type in the keyboard shortcut Win+R to bring up Run. Then, type in "diskmgmt.msc" in the search bar (without quotes). It will bring up the Disk Management utility. Here, you will see a list of partitions at the top, and the partitions in box form at the bottom. Partitions are the different "sections" of the hard drive, and every OS usually has multiple partitions in use. For Ubuntu, we need to create a partition and Ubuntu will manage the partition itself. So, right-click the primary partition in your disk management tool. On my computer, it shows a "Recovery" partition and an "EFI system" partition, as well as a bigger "Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, Primary Partition". Right-click the latter partition and you should see a menu with options. One of these options should be "Shrink volume". Click on that. A pop-up will appear, saying, "Querying volume for available shrink space, please wait…" Then a pop-up will appear with some numbers. The first box states the total size of the disk before shrinking, and the next box will say the total amount of shrink space available. In the third box, where it reads "Enter the amount of shrink space", enter the amount of space you want the OS to have (in megabytes). I did 17000 because my computer only has a 128GB SSD, but we recommend doing between 20000 and 25000 megabytes. After that is done, you can click "Shrink". Once the shrinking finishes, it will show a block of "Unallocated" space. LEAVE IT ALONE.</p>
