<h1 class="Header" id="Title">Battle of the Styli: Apple Pencil, Surface Pen, or Pixelbook Pen?</h1>

<p class="Text">Both the Surface Pen and the Apple Pencil have been around for a long time. The first Surface Pen came out to the public in 2012 with the Surface Pro, and the Apple Pencil released in 2015 alongside the iPad Pro. However, now Google has thrown their own device into the mix, with the Google Pixelbook Pen (accompaniment to the Google Pixelbook). All three of these writing utensils are without doubt excellent devices, but you may want to know which one is the best of them all. Here, we will discover the answer to this question: Apple Pencil, Surface Pen, or Pixelbook Pen?</p>
<p class="Text">The main categories we will use to compare the pens are design, execution, and features, mainly because these are the most important. However, that is not to say that there aren’t other important aspects of each stylus, and we will cover those in passing during the article.</p>
<p class="Text Note">Note: The Surface Pen has gone through major changes between the latest model and the previous version. Therefore, we will refer to the latest version as 4th generation, and the pen that shipped with the Surface Pro 4 will be called 3rd generation, for the sake of comparison.</p>

<h1 class="Header">Design</h1>

<p class="Text">Only a small portion of what you may think is design is the pure aesthetic look of the pen. Although it is undeniable that the three pens look terrific, that is only part of the picture. Design is in part looks, but also includes the comfort of using the pen. Each of these three pens have their strengths and weaknesses in these two aspects. </p>
<p class="Text">The Surface Pen, in our opinion, looks the most like a normal pen. The top button slightly resembles the button of an actual pen, and similar to how there are clips on the side of every pen, there was a clip on the side of the Surface Pen (which unfortunately got removed when SP2017 released) too. To this effect, I liked the looks of the Surface Pen mainly because of the degree of realism. We do mourn the loss of a pen clip greatly, but the rest of the pen still looks fabulous and the new features definitely make up for this. Holding the Surface Pen when writing is almost identical to holding a real pen. The only difference is, obviously, that a side of the Surface Pen is flat. Therefore, when holding the pen, I put my thumb on the flat side with my index and middle finger resting on the opposite side. It worked very well. The pen didn’t slip out of my hand, and I could write with the pen well even while gripping it very lightly. For such a smooth pen, I was surprised that it didn’t fall out of my hands, but it stayed there.</p>
<p class="Text">On the other hand, the Apple Pencil looks similar to a real pencil. The streamlined shape and point of the Pencil bear closely resemble the No. 2 pencil, with the top part being the only major difference; the top of the Apple Pencil is rounded, unlike the flatter look of a pencil eraser. Unlike the Surface Pen, there are no protrusions or any add-ons to the chassis of the pen, save for a Lightning connector which is used to charge the Pencil (more on this soon). In terms of comfort, the Apple Pencil was essentially the same as the Surface Pen. Although completely round, one could hold the pen in such a way that it didn’t fall out of your hand, regardless of how smooth it was to the touch. Since the Pencil has such an amazing tilt feature, the lack of a flat side to grip could prove a blessing in disguise. You can easily loosen your hold just enough to slide the stylus a little bit farther out of your hand, and use the side of the tip to shade lightly in an area. I have to admit, this was a very well thought out part of the device. </p>
<p class="Text">When I first saw pictures of the Pixelbook Pen, I hated it. I detested the flat top, the size, and the general shape of the stylus. Then, I looked at it in person, and it was shockingly better than I expected. First, it is not as short as pictures make it out to be. It is actually longer than the Surface Pen, with a length of 147mm over Surface Pen’s 145. Second, the pen is definitely thicker than the other two, but is still thin enough so the flat top does not prove to be extremely detractive. Finally, the rounded portion leading up to the tip of the pen looks, in my opinion, beautiful. The Pixelbook Pen feels great to hold, too, although holding it is a different experience than holding the other styli. Since the end of the pen is bell-shaped rather than pointy, you can choke farther up on your pen grip. However, one thing I don’t like is that the button aligns with your top fingers rather than the thumb. That is merely a matter of preference, however, and you may like having a button under your index finger. And it is good that the button is aligned perfectly with the finger, because you can use that button for a whole host of other features that come with the Google Pixelbook.</p>

  <button id="BackToTop" onclick="topFunction()">
   <strong>
    Back to top
   </strong>
  </button>
  <script>
   $("#BackToTop").hide();
        $(function () {
          $(window).scroll(function () {
			      if ($(this).scrollTop() > 10) {
				      $('#BackToTop').fadeIn();
			      } else {
				      $('#BackToTop').fadeOut();
			      }
		      });
		      $('#BackToTop').click(function () {
			      $('body,html').animate({
				      scrollTop: 0
			      }, 800);
			      return false;
		      });
	      });
  </script>
 </body>
