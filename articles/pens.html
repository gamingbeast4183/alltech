<h1 class="Header" id="Title">Battle of the Styli: Apple Pencil, Surface Pen, or Pixelbook Pen?</h1>

<p class="Text">Both the Surface Pen and the Apple Pencil have been around for a long time. The first Surface Pen came out to the public in 2012 with the Surface Pro, and the Apple Pencil released in 2015 alongside the iPad Pro. However, now Google has thrown their own device into the mix, with the Google Pixelbook Pen (accompaniment to the Google Pixelbook). All three of these writing utensils are without doubt excellent devices, but you may want to know which one is the best of them all. Here, we will discover the answer to this question: Apple Pencil, Surface Pen, or Pixelbook Pen?</p>
<p class="Text">The main categories we will use to compare the pens are design, execution, and features, mainly because these are the most important. However, that is not to say that there arenâ€™t other important aspects of each stylus, and we will cover those in passing during the article.</p>
<p class="Note">Note: The Surface Pen has gone through major changes between the latest model and the previous version. Therefore, we will refer to the latest version as 4th generation, and the pen that shipped with the Surface Pro 4 will be called 3rd generation, for the sake of comparison.</p>
