		<h1>The iPhone 8<h1>
<center>
<p>The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. A very boring phone to look at, with a very 2014 design. Because, it is a 2014 design. Ever since the iPhone 6 has been released, every iPhone after that was an extremely similar shape, with a few tweaks in the design. For example, it all changed when Apple trashed the audio jack with the iPhone 7 and the camera bump was altered on the back side of the phone. And now, iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. The exact same thing with a glass back. But besides aesthetics, everything inside this phone is very 2017. Even though this phone might not receive all the attention it deserves, don't judge a book by its cover; it will be a marvelous product from Apple this year.<p>

<h1>The Meat<h1>
<p>Apple never compromises on the power of the iPhone. The tech giant threw in its newest Apple A11 processor and the M11 motion co-processor. Paired with 3 gigs of RAM, Apple has made a very solid phone. Since Apple's software is not very demanding for power, these phones run very smoothly. It is running Apple's latest iOS version, iOS 11.1, which isn't very good though. iOS 11 is very buggy, and is draining the battery of many iPhone users. But these new iPhones are able to run smoothly thanks to their new processors and better batteries. Ultimately, the iPhone 8 is very capable in modern standards, and it will be for many years.<p>

<h1>Cameras<h1>

<p>Apple has proven to us that iPhone has some of the best cameras on the market right now. The iPhone 8 has one 12-megapixel sensor while the 8 Plus has a dual camera setup with two 12 megapixel sensors, allowing the 8 and 8 Plus to take great shots. The cameras are what you would expect from Apple. Great sensors that are capable of taking great shots. You get great low light photos from both phones, and the 8 Plus takes advantage of its dual camera system to take great portrait photos. We have seen this dual camera system work a lot better in the 7 Plus from its launch to now thanks to software updates. The iPhone 8 Plus has better sensors and it is coming straight out with iOS 11, meaning you will be able to take great portrait shots right out of the box, not needing to rely on software updates to pull out the cameras' maximum potential.<p>
<h1>Software<h1>

<p>If you are an iOS user, you know how clean and simple the UI is. It may not be very customizable, which may push some away, but Apple knows how to make use of their software to give users the best experience possible. iOS 11 runs perfectly fine, but the battery life is questionable. I know that some of the older phones cannot run iOS 11 as smoothly as the newer devices, but on the iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8+ it works flawlessly. I have nothing else to say about it. iOS is a really light operating system, and with the brand-new chip, it barely has to try to run the phone well. And because the operating system is so light, it barely needs any RAM. Even if I have lots of apps running in the background, the phone still runs at its best. When doing something that requires a bit more power, it still won't stress the processor that much. You might drain the battery a bit, but nothing more. My experience with the phone has been mostly crystal clear.<p>
<h1>Day to Day Use<h1>

<p>It's what you would expect from an iPhone. A simple, fast device, that can take great pictures, and can handle your day to day tasks easily. I have taken some amazing pictures with the camera system, and the portrait mode works like a charm. I have not experienced any lag myself, and the experience is generally quite nice. Something that does irk me a little, though, is the battery. It isn't the best, and charging it isn't the best thing either. If you aren't depending on your phone for everything you do, it may be fine, but if you are constantly using your phone, you may find yourself having to charge in the middle of the day. The 8+ has no issues though. It comfortably lasted me the whole day. These phones do not come with quick charging, and that is something that Android phones are coming out with these days, but Apple is Apple, and they still haven't done anything about it. If you have the 19W iPad charger, use it; you will thank me later. But all in all, my day to day use is pretty positive with this phone.<p>

<h1>Overall<h1>

<p>The iPhone 8 is a spectacular device. For the standard iPhone user, it fulfills everything it needs to and continues the iPhone legacy. It has a quality camera, great display, and provides a good experience for a casual user. However, it can get a little boring if you have been using an Android phone for a while and are wanting to make the switch. Our advice? Other devices will eventually come out to sway you between OSes, but this one isn't it. Apple users should get this device, and Android users stay Android for the time being. <p>
