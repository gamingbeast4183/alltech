 +	<h3>Coming this Black Friday</h3> 
 
<p>As Black Friday is starting to creep closer and closer, us tech enthusiasts take this as an opportunity to save some big bucks on the best tech deals. This means 10s to 100s of dollars off on retail prices, meaning you can spend that extra cash on extra tech or maybe use that money on the holidays (or you can be boring and save for retirement, jk). Here at Alltech, we want your treasure hunting experience to be the best it can be this Black Friday, so we have compiled a list of the top 5 stores you NEED to visit this Black Friday if you are a techie like us.</p> 
 
<h3>The Top 5 Stores for Black Friday</h3> 
 
<h4>Costco</h4> 
<p>If you don't have a Costco membership, you're out of luck. Costco already has many great tech deals throughout the year, but nothing beats Black Friday in this warehouse. From the little to the big, Costco has it all. I would say the best doorbuster-type deals in Costco are the Fitbit Charge 2, the 2 pack Google home, and the Lenovo 320, with the new 8th gen intel core i5 processor, 12 gigs of ram, and 1 terabyte of HDD. Not only is this a great work laptop, you might even be able to do some light gaming on this machine. If you really want to save on a laptop, or you just want to save a few bucks this Black Friday, Costco is a store you should definitely check out.</p> 
 
<h4>Best Buy</h4> 
<p>This one is kind of obvious, as Best Buy is a designated store just for tech, but this year, I think it I a big deal. Best buy has some of the best discounts on tech for Black Friday, no arguments. Surface pro core m is $629. Considering how much a Surface usually costs you, this is a deal to jump at, plus, it comes with the keyboard. The Google home mini comes at $30 with a $10 Best Buy card. Good discount with 10 more dollars to spend. Sweet! The next one may not be for everyone, but it has to be mentioned. The 11.6 inch Samsung Chromebook. At a $100, you get a lot: 2 gigs of ram and 16 gigs of storage. Chrome OS doesn't need much so the specs are totally fine. If you want a bit more thought, you will pay more, $20 more that is. For $120, you can get the same thing but with twice the RAM and storage.</p> 
<p>We can't possibly list all the good deals here, but we can show you a few more:</p> 
<p>50" 4K Samsung Smart TV - $400, 
43" 4k LG Smart TV - $280, 
DJI Spark Quadcopter w/ 1080p video - $400, 
Xbox One S 500 GB - $190, 
MacBook air 13.3 Intel Core i5 8GB RAM, 128GB Flash Storage- $800</p> 
 
<p>I think now you understand why Best Buy is so beneficial to visit.</p> 
 
<h4>Target</h4> 
<p>This one is kind of weird. Target is more of your neighborhood store, that has a little bit of everything. But Target can be a gold mine during the holiday season. The best deal there is in the store in my opinion is the Google Home Mini for $30 only, and you get a $10 Target gift card. Pick this up for yourself or as a gift for someone else. If you prefer Amazon Alexa, the Amazon Echo Mini is also $30, but doesn't come with the bonus gift card. Let's say that you want a good TV, but don't want to break the bank. This is also the place. A 55" 4K Smart TV made by a reliable brand will set you back by around $500. That is really good, 55" is pretty large, for a fraction of the price of those expensive things that the manufacturers want you to buy. No matter what the original price is for these cheap TV's it will always be a good deal. If you are a gamer, and want to save, great games start at $10. And NBA 2K 18, FIFA 18, WWE 2K 18, and more are only $30. These games are originally $60, and no matter what, you are probably not gonna find a better place for these games. All I am saying is, Target is a pretty good place to stop at if you want some tech for a reasonable price.</p> 
 
<h4>Walmart</h4> 
<p>Great. Another neighborhood store. But Walmart isn't exactly that. Walmart is huge, and they sell great stuff, for low prices. Usually during this time, Walmart sells super cheap TV's, that are usually Roku TV. No complaints, as long as it works, I'm ok with it. But this year, Walmart has a deal you can't pass up. For $300, you can get a 55" 4K Sharp Smart Tv. $300, just $300! That is incredible. Of course Walmart does have other deals, once you see the TV, all the other deals seem mediocre. So you just picked up that TV you wanted, now you need a sound system. For just $139, you can get a Dolby 5.1 surround sound system, but the price does come with a sacrifice. The soundbar is only 32". But I am willing to overlook that just by looking at the price. And while you are at it, get LG's 4K blu-ray player for $100. So for $439, you have you brand new entertainment system. You can thank us later. And for the gamers, you can get a 4 piece Razer gaming bundle, that includes the Razer Cynosa Pro keyboard, the DeathAdder mouse, the Kraken headset, and the Goliathus mouse pad. Might not be the fancy wireless you might be looking for, but it is definetly worth checking out. </p> 
<p>We don’t want to waste your time, so we are just going to list some of the other cool deals:</p> 
 
<p>32 GB SanDisk Flash Drive - $5,  
IPad 5th Gen. 32 GB - $250, 
Skullcandy Uproar Bluetooth Headphone - $25, 
JBL Flip 3 Bluetooth Speaker - $55, 
Google Chromecast w. $5 Vudu credit - $20, 
Seagate 1TB Hard Drive - $45</p> 
 
<p>Yes, yes, these are all deals at Walmart. And these aren't even all of them. Going to Walmart is definitely worth it, and if you don't you are gonna be missing out on a lot of good stuff.</p> 
 
<h4>Kohl's</h4> 
<p>Yes. I am serious. Kohl's. This isn't just your regular clothes and accessories shopping center anymore. Kohls means business during Black Friday. Kohl's Cash is a rewards system I guess. You buy stuff and they give you a voucher that acts as in store currency. And they are giving a lot of this stuff out. And I think that the dealbuster in this store is the 55" 4K Smart TV for $500. And get this, you get $150 Kohl's Cash. You could go buy another TV! If you want something smaller, we got you covered. A 49" 4K LG Smart TV will set you back $400, and you get $120 Kohl's Cash. And for the gamers out there, you can get a gaming chair with built in speakers for $40 dollars. And a cheap VR headset is $10. If you want better quality, you can pay $50 for the Zeiss VR headset and get $15 Kohl's Cash. While Kohls may not have much tech, the tech they do have is really good, and prices are excellent. Time to put some time into your shopping schedule and make a list!</p> 
 
<h3>What is the Ultimate Store?</h3> 
 
<p>We don’t know. It depends on what you actually need. For all I know, I'm gonna be going to all of them, because not all the deals are listed in store ads. But from what I have seen, all of them are good. If you want a TV, Walmart and Kohl's are probably your best bet. If you are looking for a little bit of everything, Costco is pretty good. They have low prices and many things, and they have some of the best stuff. Tech gifts and accessories, Target. Best Buy is for the person that has the money or isn't looking for anything specific. So, based on what we have said here, take a deeper look into that store if you are interested, and maybe you will find something that is truly waiting for you to pick it up. So, until Black Friday does come around, when you guys are looking at Black Friday ads, we here at AllTech would like to wish you all good luck on your wish list writing.</p>
